> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

#Then you need to create a file named .babelrc right in the project folder 
#and write the following codes in it so that we will not encounter problems 
#in mapping operations related to Store.
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", { "modules": false }],
    "stage-3"
  ]
}

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
